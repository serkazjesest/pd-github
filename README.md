1) Predictor_preproceccing - responsible for data collection for the model
2) Predictor_main - the script that runs the model on the collected data and outputs the dataframe with the results of the analysis to the console

P.S.: This repository does not contain, and most likely will not contain, the code of the trained model and the data it was trained on.
Also, there will be no code, thanks to which the data for training were collected.

Thank you.
