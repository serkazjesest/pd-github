All the code was written using the mechanisms described in the article "The Anatomy of a Cryptocurrency. Pump-and-Dump Scheme" by Jiahua Xu and Benjamin Livshits. The main essence of the code, fragments of which are presented in this repository, is the prediction of pump'n'dump schemes in the cryptocurrency market.

1) Predictor_preproceccing - responsible for data collection for the model
2) Predictor_main - the script that runs the model on the collected data and outputs the dataframe with the results of the analysis to the console

P.S.: This repository does not contain, and most likely will not contain, the code of the trained model and the data it was trained on.
Also, there will be no code, thanks to which the data for training were collected.

Thank you.
